Your answer:    A good pair programming technique is a dual role of Driver and Navigator. The driver will do all the physical typing, editor usage, and hand eye coordination of writing code, while the navigator will provide guidance, psuedocoding verbage, problem solving, and/or research solutions to a problem.

Researched answer:  The driver and navigator work together within 1 workstation. The driver does all the typing while the navigator analyzes all lines of code and observers for bugs, solutions, and outcomes.
